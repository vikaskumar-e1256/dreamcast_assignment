To run a Laravel project after cloning it from GitHub, follow these steps:

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository.

### 2. **Navigate to Project Directory**

Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of the directory that was created by cloning the repository.

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

### 4. **Set Up Environment Configuration**

Copy the example environment file to create your local environment configuration file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate a new application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

Link storage:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

### 5. **Configure the Environment**

Edit the `.env` file to configure database and other environment settings. Ensure you set the correct database connection settings and any other required environment variables.

### 6. **Run Database Migrations and Seeders**

If the project includes database migrations and seeders, run:

```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

### 7. **Start the Development Server**

Start the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:8000` by default.

### 8. **Access the Application**

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to view the application.

### 9. **Troubleshooting**

- **Check Logs:** If you encounter any issues, check the Laravel log file located in `storage/logs/laravel.log`.
- **Permissions:** Ensure that the `storage` and `bootstrap/cache` directories have the correct permissions.


Following these steps will get your Laravel project up and running locally after cloning it from GitHub.
